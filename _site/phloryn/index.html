      <h2>Critical Moment 1: Unsupported Knight Advance</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Nc4??</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Bxb3</span></p>
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>This moment is critical because you placed your knight (from b6) onto the c4 square, which looks active but is tactically unsupported and creates a dangerous overload of your bishop on e6. White had just played <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">9. d4</span>, attacking your e5 pawn.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your knight on c4 creates two serious problems: (1) it doesn't help defend the attacked e5 pawn because the knight can be captured and the pawn e5 is still not protected twice, and (2) it overloads your bishop on e6, which now has to defend both the knight and guard against a potential Ng5 attack. White missed the strongest reply (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10. Ng5</span>), which would have attacked your bishop on e6 and forced it to move, leaving your knight on c4 hanging. The evaluation jumped from +0.45 to +2.77 in White's favor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">9... Bxb3</span> was the simplest and best move.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Trading the bishops with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">9...Bxb3</span> resolves the pressure from White's active bishop on b3. It simplifies the position safely, keeps material even, and prepares for standard development like ...Bg7 and ...O-O without creating tactical weaknesses. Most importantly, it avoids the overload of your e6 bishop that occurs after Nc4, which makes you vulnerable to the Ng5 tactic.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Piece Safety & Overloaded Defenders. Avoid creating situations where a single piece must defend multiple targets simultaneously. The Be6 became overloaded after Nc4, having to defend both the knight and guard against Ng5. Before advancing pieces to active but unsupported squares, ensure they have adequate protection and don't create tactical vulnerabilities for other pieces.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 2: Missing a Simple Recapture</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">b5?</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Nxd2</span></p>
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>White missed the best move (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10. Ng5</span>) and instead played <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10. Nbd2</span>, directly challenging your knight on c4. This gave you a golden opportunity to resolve the awkwardness of the c4 knight by simply capturing the d2 knight.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Instead, playing <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10... b5?</span> attempted to support the c4 knight with a pawn, but this ignored the immediate capture available and fatally weakened your pawn structure after White inevitably captured on c4. The evaluation shifted from +0.91 to +2.64 in White's favor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10... Nxd2</span> was the correct and simple recapture. The engine line is: <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10... Nxd2 11. Bxd2</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10...Nxd2</span> immediately trades the awkwardly placed knight on c4 for White's newly developed knight on d2. After White recaptures (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">11. Bxd2</span>), you've eliminated your weak piece, kept the material equal, and can proceed with development like ...Bg7 and ...O-O. The move <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">10...b5?</span> fails positionally because White can play <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">11. Nxc4</span>. If you recapture <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">11...bxc4</span>, your pawns are doubled and weak. If you recapture <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">11...Bxc4</span> (as played), White trades bishops (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">12. Bxc4</span>) and you still end up with doubled, isolated pawns after <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">12...bxc4</span>, giving White a large advantage due to your damaged structure.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Calculation Errors & Recapture Priority. Always calculate immediate captures and recaptures first, especially when pieces are in direct contact. Don't get sidetracked by other plans (like supporting the knight with a pawn) when a simple, forcing capture resolves the tension favorably.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 3: Capitalizing on an Opponent's Blunder</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> White plays 22. Rd5??<br>
      <strong>Your Response:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">b4!</span></p>
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>This was a major turning point where your opponent blundered away a significant advantage. White played <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">22. Rd5??</span>, placing the rook aggressively to attack your b5 pawn, but tactically overlooking the safety of their own pawns and the potential for your counterplay.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your response, <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">22... b4!</span>, was excellent. It correctly identified that White's rook was misplaced and initiated a tactical sequence to win back material and equalize the game. This moved the evaluation from +2.38 to +0.53, essentially equalizing the position.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>How You Capitalized:</strong> Your move <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">22...b4!</span> forced White's hand. After <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">23. cxb4</span> (capturing your pawn), you were able to play <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">23... Rxa2</span>, winning White's undefended pawn on a2 with your rook. The sequence continued <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">24. b3 Rb2 25. Rb5 Rb8 26. Kf1 Rxb3</span>, where you successfully captured the b3 pawn as well, regaining material equality and entering a drawn rook endgame.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it Worked:</strong> White's <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">22. Rd5??</span> was greedy. It moved the rook off the defense of the a-pawn and ignored the tactical possibility of your ...b4 pawn push disrupting the defense of White's c3-pawn (although capturing the a2 pawn was the direct gain). Your counterattack exploited the temporary vulnerability of White's position, specifically the pawns on the queenside.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Exploiting Opponent's Errors & Counterattack. Even when you are in a worse position, always stay alert for tactical mistakes from your opponent. Look for active counterattacking moves, like pawn breaks (...b4) or piece activations, that can disrupt their plans and exploit misplaced pieces (like the Rd5). A single tactical oversight can erase a large advantage.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 4: Endgame Tactical Oversight</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Ke6??</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Bc7</span></p>
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>This was the decisive tactical error in the endgame. The position was roughly equal, a K + Bishop vs. K + Knight endgame. By moving your king to e6 with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">37... Ke6??</span>, you stepped into a fatal tactical sequence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>White's knight on c6 and pawn on e4 combined to create a threat against your bishop on e5 that you couldn't parry without significant material loss or ending up in a lost king and pawn endgame. The evaluation swung dramatically from +0.37 to +5.15 in White's favor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">37... Bc7</span> was a safe move, keeping the bishop active while avoiding immediate tactics. The engine suggests: <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">37... Bc7 38. Kd3</span> - simply repositioning the bishop.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Moving the bishop to c7 with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">37...Bc7</span> keeps it safe and flexible. Crucially, it avoids the tactical shot White had after <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">37...Ke6??</span>. The move Ke6 allows White to play <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">38. Nxe5!</span>. Now, if you recapture with the king (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">38...Kxe5</span>), you are simply down a pawn. If you recapture with the pawn (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">38...fxe5?!</span>, as played in the game), White achieves a winning king and pawn endgame due to the additional pawn and White's king has easy access to key squares (like f4 and g5).</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Endgame Calculation & King Safety. King activity is important in the endgame, but king safety remains paramount. Meticulously check for tactical shots like checks, forks, or sequences that force unfavorable exchanges. Knights are particularly tricky in endgames; always calculate their potential jumps carefully. A single misstep with the king can be fatal.</p>

  <h2>Final Tips</h2>
  <p>These moments highlight the importance of:</p>
  <ul class="tips-list">
    <li><strong>Piece safety and coordination:</strong> Avoid placing pieces on unsupported squares without tactical justification. As seen in moment 1, the unsupported knight on c4 created an immediate weakness.</li>
    <li><strong>Tactical awareness:</strong> Always look for immediate captures and recaptures first. The oversight in moment 2 could have been avoided by simply capturing with the knight.</li>
    <li><strong>Counterattack opportunities:</strong> Stay alert for tactical mistakes from your opponent. Your excellent counterplay in moment 3 demonstrates how quickly a position can equalize when you spot tactical opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Endgame king activity with caution:</strong> While king centralization is important in endgames, it must be done with tactical awareness. The endgame mistake in moment 4 shows how a seemingly active king move can walk into tactical problems.</li>
