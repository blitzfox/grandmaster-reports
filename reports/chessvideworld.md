      <h2>Critical Moment 1: Knight Sacrifice Opportunity Missed</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> Nc3+?<br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> Nf4</p>
      
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>Black plays Nc3+, moving the knight from d5 to c3 to check the white king. This is a tactical mistake because after Bxc3 Qxc3, White's pieces become very active, and Black's queen is exposed on c3. The evaluation swings from -0.33 to +1.01 in White's favor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> 12... Nf4 13. Qe3 Nxd3 14. Qxd3 Nf6 15. d5 O-O</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Nf4 maintains control over key squares and avoids exposing the queen. The knight on f4 is more stable and doesn't allow White to activate their pieces as easily.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Avoid unnecessary checks that don't lead to concrete advantages. Exposing your queen early can lead to vulnerabilities.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 2: Exploiting the Exposed Queen</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Mistake:</strong> Nf6?<br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> O-O</p>
      
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>Black plays Nf6, moving the knight from d7 to f6, missing the tactical threat of White's h5-g6 pawn push. This allows White to open the h-file and exploit the weakened kingside. The evaluation swings from -0.26 to +1.30 in White's favor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> 17... O-O</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Castling removes the king from the center and avoids the immediate tactical threats on the kingside. The king would be safer, and Black could focus on counterplay.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> King safety is paramount. Delaying castling in open positions can lead to devastating tactical blows.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 3: Blunder in Time Trouble</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> Rb8??<br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> Rd8</p>
      
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>Black plays Rb8, moving the rook from c8 to b8, a blunder that allows White to exploit the pinned queen on e8. The evaluation swings from +0.63 to +2.72 in White's favor.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> 28... Rd8 29. Qf3 Rd6 30. Rde1 Rxd4 31. c3 Rdh4 32. g3 R4h5 33. g4 Rh3 34. Qb7</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Rd8 defends the queen and maintains coordination between the rooks. The rook on d8 also controls key central squares and prevents White from infiltrating.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Always check for pins and undefended pieces before moving. Rooks should be placed on open or semi-open files where they can defend and attack effectively.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 4: Missed Tactic</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> White to move<br>
      <strong>Mistake:</strong> Qf5??<br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> Nc6</p>
      
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>White plays Qf5, moving the queen from f3 to f5, missing a winning tactical sequence with Nc6. The evaluation swings from +4.60 to +0.36, a massive drop.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> 30. Nc6 Ne4 31. Qxe4 Qxe4 32. Rxe4 Rf8 33. f3 Rh2 34. Rg4 Bf6 35. Nxa7 Re8</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Nc6 forks the queen on e8 and the rook on b8, winning material. After the forced sequence, White emerges with a significant material advantage and a winning position.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Always look for forks and other tactical motifs when your pieces are active. Knights are especially effective at creating forks in crowded positions.</p>

  <h2>Final Tips</h2>
  <p>These moments highlight the importance of:</p>
  <ul class="tips-list">
    <li><strong>Tactical awareness:</strong> Always check for pins, forks, and other tactical motifs before making a move. The missed Nc6 fork in moment 4 shows how overlooking a tactical opportunity can completely change the outcome.</li>
    <li><strong>King safety:</strong> As seen in moment 2, delaying castling in open positions can lead to devastating attacks. Prioritize king safety when the center is open or when your opponent has active pieces.</li>
    <li><strong>Piece coordination:</strong> In moment 3, the Rb8 blunder disrupted piece coordination. Keep your pieces working together and watch for defensive relationships between them.</li>
    <li><strong>Avoid unnecessary checks:</strong> As seen in moment 1, checks that don't lead to concrete advantages can waste tempo and expose your pieces to counterattacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Consider piece placement:</strong> Place rooks on open files where they can be most effective, and position knights where they control important central squares.</li>
  </ul>
