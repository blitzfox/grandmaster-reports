      <h2>Critical Moment 1: The Bishop Sacrifice</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Bxh3??</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Nf7</span></p>
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>This was a very bold move, sacrificing your dark-squared bishop on h3. The idea, common in such positions, is usually to shatter the opponent's kingside pawn cover (gxh3) and open lines for your queen and rook (after potentially moving the knight) to attack the exposed king. However, in this specific position, the sacrifice was tactically unsound.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it didn't work:</strong> After White played <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">14. gxh3</span>, your attack didn't have enough force. Your queen on d6 was aimed at h2, and your rook on f8 was ready, but White still had defenders. Crucially, your knight on h6 wasn't ideally placed to join the attack quickly, and White's rook on e7 and bishop on g5 provided counter-pressure and defensive cover. White wasn't forced into a losing position, and you were simply down a piece without sufficient compensation. The evaluation swung sharply in White's favor (+0.13 to +2.64) because the attack wasn't decisive.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">13... Nf7 14. Bh4 g5 15. Qh5 h6 16. Rxd7 Qxd7</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> The move <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">13...Nf7</span> develops the knight from the awkward h6 square and attacks White's active bishop on g5, forcing it to retreat. This keeps material even and maintains the tension without committing to a risky sacrifice. The engine line shows a complex middlegame where Black untangles their pieces and prepares for counterplay, a much safer approach than the immediate sacrifice.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Calculate Sacrifices Carefully. Sacrifices like Bxh3 need concrete follow-ups. Before sacrificing material, ensure you have calculated forcing lines that lead to mate, significant material regain, or a lasting, overwhelming attack. If the opponent has defensive resources or your attacking pieces aren't coordinated, the sacrifice is likely unsound. Don't sacrifice just hoping something will work out.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 2: Capitalizing on the King Walk</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> White to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Kxf2??</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Rxg7+</span></p> 
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>This moment was a huge turning point, created by your opponent's blunder. After your follow-up sacrifice <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">14...Rxf2</span>, White decided to capture the rook with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15. Kxf2</span>. This was a critical mistake because it walked the king directly into a powerful attack from your queen, starting with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15...Qh2+</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why White's move failed:</strong> Capturing the rook looked tempting materially, but it ignored king safety. The White king on f2 became incredibly exposed, cut off from safety and vulnerable to checks from your queen along the light squares (h2, g3). Your subsequent checks (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15...Qh2+, 16...Qg3+, 17...Qxg5+</span>) harassed the king and allowed you to regain material (the bishop on g5) while keeping the initiative. The evaluation swung dramatically back in your favor (-0.36) because White's king was now the primary target.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation (for White):</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15. Rxg7+ Kxg7 16. Bxh6+ Kxh6 17. Kxf2 Qh2+ 18. Ke1 Re8+ 19. Be2</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it was better (for White):</strong> The key difference is the *zwischenzug* (in-between move) <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15. Rxg7+</span>. Before capturing your rook on f2, White should have first captured your bishop on g7 *with check*. This removes a key defender of the light squares around White's king. After <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15...Kxg7</span>, White could then play <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">16. Bxh6+</span> (another check), and only then <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">17. Kxf2</span>. This sequence would have left White up material with a safer king, maintaining a winning advantage.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> King Safety Over Material. When facing an attack, especially one involving sacrifices near your king, prioritize king safety above grabbing material immediately. Look for checks or captures that disrupt the opponent's attack (like White's missed <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">15. Rxg7+</span>). As the attacker, punish exposed kings by finding forcing checks and captures to exploit the situation immediately.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 3: Seizing the Opportunity</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> White to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Kd1??</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Bd3</span></p>
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>After a sequence where you had good pressure (<span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">18...Re8, 19...Nf5, 20...Bh6</span> pinning the rook on e3 to the queen on e2), White made another decisive blunder with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">21. Kd1</span>. This move stepped the king off the e-file but onto the d-file, right into a attack scenario involving your bishop on h6 and rook on e8.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why White's move failed:</strong> Moving the king to d1 allowed your rook on e8 to capture White's rook on e3 with <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">21...Rxe3</span>.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation (for White): </strong> Instead playing  <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">21. Bd3</span> would move the attacked White bishop to safety. After Rxe3, White has Qg4! maintaining a balanced position</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it was better (for White):</strong> Playing <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">21. Bd3</span> would have prevented material from being lost</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Recognize Pins and Discovered Attacks. Always be careful of unneeded kings moves and keep an eye on material.</p>

      <h2>Critical Moment 4: Letting the Win Slip</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="moment-content">
      <p><strong>Position:</strong> Black to move<br>
      <strong>Blunder:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Kg7?</span><br>
      <strong>Stronger Move:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">f4</span></p>
      
      <div class="coach-feedback">
        <p>You had reached an endgame with an extra pawn and active pieces, holding a winning advantage (-1.43). However, playing <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">32...Kg7</span> allowed White back into the game, leading to equality (0.0).</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it didn't work:</strong> The move <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">32...Kg7</span> seems natural, bringing the king closer to the center. However, it neglected a crucial tactical detail: White's knight could now become very active via <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">33. Nh4</span>. This move attacked your pawn on f5 and prepared Nf5+, forking your king and bishop. After <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">33...f4</span> (forced, to save the pawn), White played <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">34. Nf5+ Kg6 35. Nxh6 Kxh6 36. Rxf4</span>. White regained the pawn on f4, and the resulting rook endgame was drawn. Your king move allowed White tactical counterplay that liquidated the position to equality.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">32... f4 33. Re1</span></p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Why it's better:</strong> Playing <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">32...f4</span> immediately secures your passed pawn structure on the kingside (f5 and f4). It prevents White's knight from ever accessing the powerful f5 square via Nh4. By solidifying your pawn advantage and restricting White's knight, you would have maintained control and kept excellent winning chances by pushing your passed pawns or coordinating your rook and bishop against White's king.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Principle:</strong> Prophylaxis and Pawn Structure in Endgames. In the endgame, small tactical details and pawn structure become critical. Before making a standard developing move (like bringing the king up), check for concrete tactical threats your opponent might have. Here, preventing <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">Nh4-f5+</span> with the prophylactic move <span style="background-color: #e8e8e8; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px; font-family: monospace; font-weight: 600;">32...f4</span> was more important than activating the king immediately. Securing passed pawns and restricting opponent counterplay is often key to converting endgame advantages.</p>

  <h2>Final Tips</h2>
  <p>These moments highlight the importance of:</p>
  <ul class="tips-list">
    <li><strong>Sacrifice calculation:</strong> Always calculate sacrifices thoroughly, ensuring you have concrete follow-ups rather than hoping for an attack to materialize. As seen in Critical Moment 1, sacrifices need proper preparation and coordination.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploiting king vulnerability:</strong> When an opponent's king is exposed, look for forcing moves like checks and captures to maintain pressure. Your successful exploitation of White's king walk in Critical Moment 2 shows the power of keeping initiative against an exposed king.</li>
    <li><strong>Tactical awareness:</strong> Always be alert to tactical patterns like pins and discovered checks. The decisive tactical shot in Critical Moment 3 demonstrates how geometric relationships between pieces can create winning opportunities.</li>
    <li><strong>Prophylactic thinking:</strong> In endgames, preventing your opponent's counterplay is often as important as advancing your own plan. The missed opportunity in Critical Moment 4 highlights the importance of securing advantages and eliminating potential tactical threats before proceeding with standard plans.</li>
  </ul>
